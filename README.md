# zMemo #

zMemo is intended to be a knowledge bot. As a first step, I will have it
statically respond to phrases, much like *bucket*. Ideally, I'll have it parse
natural language questions and respond with factoids or links to more
information. For a realm of knowledge, I will be using non-confidential
information from work, ideally to help out new hires. 

## Usage ##

Add zMemo to a (private or group) conversation and then direct your messages to it.

## Examples ##

    <You> @zMemo massages
    <zMemo> @You Go to http://url/to/massages for more about massages.
    
    <You> zMemo: shuttle
    <zMemo> You: Go to http://info/about/shuttles for more about shuttle.

    <You> zMemo, svn access
    <zMemo> You, I don't know anything about svn access. Help me out when you find out by saying: svn access is http://info/about/svn/access
    <You> zMemo, svn access is http://how/to/access/svn
    <zMemo> You, thanks. I now know about svn access.
    <You> zMemo, svn access
    <zMemo> You, go to http://how/to/access/svn for more about svn access.
    
## Notes ##

This is purely an experiment. I have no knowledge of natural language
processing but I'm interested in learning more. Also, I'm pretty sure that I'm
obliged to state that this is purely my own project and has nothing to do with
my employer, the work I do for my employer, and not be taken to reflect upon
the quality, capacity, and/or interests of my employer.
